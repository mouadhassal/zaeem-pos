# FEATURE_TRUTH.md — Honest Feature Inventory

**Generated:** 2026-07-14
**Method:** Code-only audit. Every claim is backed by a file:line reference. README claims are compared against what actually executes at runtime.

---

## Classification Key

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `WORKS` | Implemented, exercised, no known gap at the code level |
| `PARTIAL` | Happy path only, or logic exists but is disconnected from the runtime |
| `STUB` | UI exists, no logic behind it |
| `FICTION` | Claimed in some document, does not exist in code |

---

## Architecture Verdict

**Current state:** The frontend owns the database. All business logic lives in TypeScript calling SQLite via Kysely. Rust has 17 commands but they cover only auth, debt, kitchen display, settings, and diagnostics — none of the core POS flow (orders, payments, inventory, menu) goes through Rust.

**CLAUDE.md R1 violation:** `getDb()` is called at 37 sites across `src/`. All order, payment, inventory, and menu operations bypass Rust entirely.

**CLAUDE.md R5 violation:** The `audit_logs` table exists in the schema but no Rust command and no TypeScript service writes to it consistently. `db/audit.ts` has a `logAudit()` function but the first audit pass found zero callers.

## Feature-by-Feature Audit

### 1. Point of Sale — Core Flow

| Claim | Status | Evidence | Gap |
|-------|--------|----------|-----|
| Table management (FREE/OCCUPIED/MERGED) | `WORKS` | `pos/page.tsx:125-175` — tables fetched via `getDb()` → Kysely, status enum enforced by DB CHECK | All via frontend Kysely, not Rust |
| Item entry into cart | `WORKS` | `cartStore.ts` — addItem/removeItem/updateQuantity, pure Zustand in-memory | — |
| Menu grid with categories | `WORKS` | `pos/page.tsx:155`, `MenuGrid.tsx` — category dock + filtered menu items | — |
| Order creation | `WORKS` | `orderService.ts:41-110` — inserts `orders` + `order_items` + `order_modifiers`, marks table OCCUPIED | All via `getDb()`, not Rust |
| Order finalization / payment | `WORKS` | `pos/page.tsx:190-270` — updates order to PAID, inserts `payments`, frees table, attempts print | Kysely frontend, no Rust |
| Payment methods (CASH/CARD/WALLET/CREDIT) | `PARTIAL` | `PaymentModal.tsx` — CASH works with change calc, CARD/WALLET are mock UI that just marks paid, CREDIT creates debt entry | Card/wallet: no real payment gateway |
| Split bill | `WORKS` | `orderService.ts:375-423` — transactional: new orders per split, items moved, original linked via `parent_order_id` | Frontend Kysely |
| Merge tables | `WORKS` | `orderService.ts:425-478` — tables marked MERGED, items moved to target, source cancelled + `unmergeTables()` at 480 | Frontend Kysely |
| Transfer order | `WORKS` | `orderService.ts:510-537` — order `table_id` updated, source table freed, target occupied | Frontend Kysely |
| Void items with reason | `WORKS` | `cartStore.ts` — `voidItem()` sets `voided=true`, `void_reason` | Frontend Kysely |
| Manager PIN for discounts/voids | `WORKS` | `ManagerPinModal.tsx` — PIN verification via authStore (compare against user's password_hash) | PIN verified in frontend, no Rust elevation token |
| Hold/retrieve draft orders | `WORKS` | `orderService.ts:129-145` save as DRAFT, `orderService.ts:147-174` retrieve items back | Frontend Kysely |
| Delayed/scheduled orders | `WORKS` | `orderService.ts:539-573` + `delayed_orders` table, 30s poll for activation | Frontend Kysely |
| Driver selection for delivery | `WORKS` | `DriverSelectModal.tsx` + `orderTypeStore.setDriverId()` | — |
| On-screen receipt fallback | `WORKS` | `OnScreenReceiptModal.tsx` + `printer.ts:532-574` HTML generation | — |
| Barcode scanner | `WORKS` | `barcodeScanner.ts` — keyboard HID buffer (50ms interval), dispatches `barcode-scanned` event | Simple listener, no Rust |

### 2. Menu Management

| Combo meal builder | `WORKS` | `menu/page.tsx:510-565` — `combo_meals` + `combo_items`, bundle pricing, free items, sort order | Admin UI works |
| Happy hour rules (per-day, time ranges) | `WORKS` | `menu/page.tsx:625-679` — day_of_week, start/end time, discount_percent CRUD | Admin UI works |
| **Happy hour affects POS pricing** | `STUB` | `happyHourStore.ts:27-43` has working time-check logic but **zero callers** in POS | No consumer: happyHourStore is never imported |
| **Combo affects POS pricing** | `PARTIAL` | `menuStore.ts:70-83` fetches combo components; `MenuGrid.tsx:23-36` shows savings label | Combo pricing shown but no cart integration to bundle-price |
| Recipe-to-ingredient linking | `PARTIAL` | Schema has `recipes` table, menu item create accepts `recipe_id` param but defaults to `null` | Admin can link, no runtime consumption |

### 16. Login & Auth — v0.1 Gaps

| Issue | Status | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Seed users with known passwords (`admin123`) | **KNOWN REGRESSION** | `lib.rs:598-630` — 4 users seeded on first run |
| Password hash comparison in renderer | **PARTIALLY FIXED (2026-07-16)** | `shift/page.tsx`'s manager-override check no longer fetches `password_hash`/`manager_pin_hash` into the frontend — replaced with Rust command `verify_manager_override` (`lib.rs`) that compares server-side and returns only a bool. **`VoidItemModal.tsx` and `ManagerPinModal.tsx` still do the old client-side-hash pattern** — deliberately left alone per T1.0a review decision; the real fix (a Rust-issued, time-boxed elevation token) is T1.4, not this interim patch. Do not consider this regression closed until T1.4 lands. |
| `lib/license.ts` returns `active` unconditionally | **KNOWN REGRESSION** | `license.ts:12-13` — always returns `{ status: "active", daysRemaining: 365 }` |
| `CSP: null` in `tauri.conf.json` | **FIXED (2026-07-15)** | `tauri.conf.json` CSP tightened: removed `unsafe-inline` from `script-src`; `connect-src` kept permissive for LAN thermal-printer HTTP traffic (a real hardware requirement, not an oversight) |
| `debug/page.tsx` reachable in release build | **FIXED (2026-07-16)** | Frontend already excluded the page from prod bundles via `import.meta.env.DEV` (`App.tsx:26-28`), but the backing Rust command `diagnose_db` had **no server-side gate** — invokable directly by any renderer script regardless of which UI route was showing, in any build. Now wrapped `#[cfg(debug_assertions)]` with a release-mode stub that returns `Err`, matching the pattern already used for `seed_default_users`. |
| Ad-hoc `ALTER TABLE` with no version table | **KNOWN REGRESSION** | `lib.rs:566-596` — ALTER TABLE wrapped in `.ok()` in init_db() |
| Permission checks in React only | **KNOWN REGRESSION** | All `canAccessX()` functions in `permissions.ts` have no Rust counterpart |
| Rust commands: zero role checks | **WIDESPREAD GAP** | All 17 commands accept any caller, no session verification |
| `audit_logs` table: created, never written to | **WIDESPREAD GAP** | `lib.rs:182` creates table, zero commands insert into it |
| Session tokens are `zaeem_{uuid}` in localStorage | **SECURITY GAP** | `lib.rs:718-790` — session tokens are `zaeem_` + uuid, no expiry |
| `create_branch` reachable from two unauthorized UI paths | **KNOWN HOLE — closing in Sprint 01 (T1.2/T1.3)** | Found in T1.0a command inventory (`docs/plans/T1.0a_COMMAND_INVENTORY.md`): reachable both from `branches/page.tsx:236-239` (OWNER-gated) and silently from `settings/page.tsx:199-215`'s `saveBranch()` else-branch (MANAGER/ADMIN-gated). Per `ARCHITECTURE_V3.md` hard rule #1, branch creation must be Platform-only. **Deliberately not patched in the frontend** — the fix is the scoped Rust command layer landing in T1.2/T1.3, which structurally rejects any non-Platform caller; a frontend-only patch here would be thrown away. |
| Staff/branch/shift aggregate queries return unscoped (global) data | **KNOWN HOLE — closing in Sprint 01 (T1.2/T1.3)** | Found in T1.0a: `branches/page.tsx`'s per-branch staff-count and today's-sales sub-queries, plus `get_staff_list`/`get_shifts`/`get_attendance` in `staff/page.tsx`, have no `branch_id` filter today (expected — the column doesn't exist yet) and silently show global figures mislabeled as per-branch. Same deliberate non-fix: correct scoping only exists once the repo-layer scope filter (T1.2) lands. |

## Summary Counts

### Architecture Compliance (vs CLAUDE.md)

| Rule | Status |
|------|--------|
| R1 — Frontend never touches DB | **FAIL** — 37 `getDb()` call sites |
| R2 — No country logic in core | **N/A** — `core/` module does not exist yet; nothing can leak into a directory that isn't there |
| R3 — Money type (not bare `_cents`) | **FAIL** — all money is `_cents: i64` everywhere |
| R4 — Orders/payments append-only | **FAIL** — orders are UPDATEd in place |
| R5 — Every mutation writes audit entry | **FAIL** — audit_logs table is dead |

## The 5 findings that most change how long Sprint 01 will take

1. **37 `getDb()` call sites must be moved to Rust** — Every order, payment, inventory, menu, staff, delivery, loyalty, and settings operation currently bypasses Rust entirely. Sprint 01's command inventory (T1.0) will be closer to 130-150 commands, not 90-130. The migration touches every store, every lib service, and most pages.

2. **Zero role checks exist on any Rust command** — The 17 commands that do exist have no auth, no session verification, no permission check. Before the frontend migration can land, the auth/RBAC skeleton must exist. This creates a dependency: T1.2 (RBAC) must precede most of T1.6 (frontend migration).

3. **`audit_logs` is a dead table** — No command writes to it. The hash-chained audit chain (Ed25519, seq, prev_hash) doesn't exist at all — not even the table columns for it. This means T1.4 is not an "add signing to existing audit" task but a "build the audit table from scratch and instrument every command" task.

4. **The current README is aspirational** — 12 `FICTION` claims and 7 `STUB` claims mean the README cannot be trusted by anyone. The honest README rewrite (T0.1 second step) will delete more than it keeps. This matters because sprint scoping was based on the README.

5. **Combined, the Money type migration (S2) and the append-only migration (S1) conflict** — Money is stored as `_cents: i64` in 30+ columns across 39 tables. The migration to `MoneySnapshot` (T2.6) and the prohibition on `UPDATE` for money (R4) mean many columns need simultaneous schema + code changes. If S1 makes orders append-only but keeps `_cents`, the S2 migration has to re-migrate those same tables a second time. The two sprints should be re-sequenced or the money migration moved into S1.

---

## Things in the codebase that alarmed me and aren't in any sprint file

1. **`diagnose_db` opens a second `Connection`** (`lib.rs:1122`) — bypassing the `Mutex<Connection>` state, inviting concurrent write races. This command exists for debugging but could corrupt the DB if called during a write.

2. **`update_order_status` accepts arbitrary strings** (`lib.rs:1047`) — no validation against the `orders.status` CHECK constraint. A caller could set status to `"FAKE"` and it would be stored. This makes the "status" column semantically meaningless as an enum.

3. **`change_password` has no caller verification** (`lib.rs:821`) — `user_id` is a parameter, not derived from auth. Any user who knows another user's old password can change it. Worse: there's no rate limiting, no current-password re-verification.

4. **POS loyalty earning is silently wrapped in try/catch** (`pos/page.tsx:299`) — if loyalty point earning fails during payment, the payment succeeds and the error is silently swallowed. The customer gets their food but loses their points. In Syrian inflation, losing points is losing real value.

5. **Payment flow is not transactional** (`pos/page.tsx:190-306`) — order creation, payment insertion, table free, loyalty points, and print are sequential await calls with no transaction wrapping. If the app crashes between "insert payment" and "free table", the table stays OCCUPIED but the order is PAID.

   **Chaos test (T0.5)**: `pnpm test:chaos` runs 200 randomized order+payment cycles with simulated crashes at random points during the write sequence. Current failure rate: **97.0%** (194/200 cycles). Primary failure mode: orders marked PAID with no corresponding payment record (DB integrity remains intact — SQLite WAL handles OS-level crashes; the failures are all application-level consistency). Fix target: Sprint 02.

6. **`lib/license.ts` is not just a stub — it's dangerous** — Returns `active` unconditionally. If someone builds a feature gate on it (which the subscription page UI hints at), the gate is trivially bypassed. The CLAUDE.md says to delete it in S1 but there's no sprint task that explicitly says to add `EntitlementAdapter`.

7. **The DB file path is never configurable** — Hardcoded as `sqlite:zaeem_pos.db` in `db/index.ts`. On Windows this resolves to `%APPDATA%/com.zaeem.pos/zaeem_pos.db` but there's no backup path, no USB fallback, no user selectable location.
